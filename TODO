=== TODO ===
* Snapshot tests [WIP; still need an Aggregate+Snapshot test]
* Fix JSDoc and all test cases to use # properly for instance methods rather than .
* Tests for corner cases (AR type mismatch when applying events, concurrency exceptions, failures at random points in tryWith) [WIP]
* REEMIT! (separate streamer instance, perhaps, with a counter reset?) (should this be handled in another layer than the framework?)
* Refactor the AR so that it no longer commits itself (tryWith should do that)
	* tryWith needs a better name!
* Provide a separate Repository component (binder?), encapsulating tryWith and a loader
	* Repository is not a good name for this functionality!
* SOA elements
	* Command envelope for ARs' use in deduplication?
* Create the CQRS part of the framework
	* Reporting Store simple interface / wrapper / container
