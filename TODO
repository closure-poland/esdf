# Testing
* Snapshot tests [WIP; still need an Aggregate+Snapshot test]
* Tests for corner cases (AR type mismatch when applying events, concurrency exceptions, failures at random points in tryWith) [WIP]

# Code quality
* Fix JSDoc and all test cases to use # properly for instance methods rather than .

# Event Sourcing
* REEMIT! (separate streamer instance, perhaps, with a counter reset?) (should this be handled in another layer than the framework?)

# Service layer and error handling
* Make tryWith abort by default, instead of retrying
	* An error flag should make it possible to indicate a possible retry
	* Optionally wrap errors in a user-supplied error container
* Rework the error label system so that it supports error containment as the preferred method of enriching errors
	* A new function, wrapError(errObject, newErrorConstructor) should be able to wrap existing errors
		* The function should make sure that all labels are inherited by the outer error
* Provide a separate Repository component (binder?), encapsulating tryWith and a loader
	* Repository is not a good name for this functionality!
* Refactor the AR so that it no longer commits itself (tryWith should do that)
	* tryWith needs a better name!
	
# CQRS
* Create the CQRS part of the framework
	* Reporting Store simple interface / wrapper / container
