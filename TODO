# Testing
* Snapshot tests [WIP; still need an Aggregate+Snapshot test]
* Tests for corner cases (AR type mismatch when applying events, concurrency exceptions, failures at random points in tryWith) [WIP]

# Code quality
* Fix JSDoc and all test cases to use # properly for instance methods rather than .

# Event Sourcing
* REEMIT! (separate streamer instance, perhaps, with a counter reset?) (should this be handled in another layer than the framework?)
	* A sourcing controller could be employed to manage event distribution to components

# CQRS
* Create the CQRS part of the framework
	* Reporting Store simple search interface
	* A mapping container for 1:1 aggregate root projections into reporting stores
